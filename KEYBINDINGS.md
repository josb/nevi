# Nevi Keybindings

Complete reference for all keybindings in Nevi. If you're familiar with Vim/Neovim, most of these will feel natural.

Every keybinding here works out of the box. To change the leader key, remap
keys, add leader shortcuts, or remap explorer and command-line keys, see
[CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#keymap).

## Normal Mode

### Basic Movement

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h` | Move cursor left |
| `j` | Move cursor down |
| `k` | Move cursor up |
| `l` | Move cursor right |

### Word Movement

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `w` | Move to start of next word |
| `W` | Move to start of next WORD (whitespace-delimited) |
| `b` | Move to start of previous word |
| `B` | Move to start of previous WORD |
| `e` | Move to end of word |
| `E` | Move to end of WORD |
| `ge` | Move to end of previous word |
| `gE` | Move to end of previous WORD |

> **Word vs WORD:** A "word" is letters/numbers/underscores. A "WORD" is anything separated by whitespace. For example, in `foo-bar`, `w` stops at `-`, but `W` jumps over the whole thing.

### Line Movement

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `0` | Move to start of line (column 0) |
| `^` | Move to first non-blank character |
| `$` | Move to end of line |
| `g_` | Move to last non-blank character (count moves lines down) |
| `\|` | Move to column [count] |
| `gM` | Move to middle of the line's text (count is a percentage) |
| `+` / `Enter` | Move to first non-blank of next line |
| `-` | Move to first non-blank of previous line |
| `gj` | Move down by display line when wrap is enabled |
| `gk` | Move up by display line when wrap is enabled |
| `g0` | Move to start of display line when wrap is enabled |
| `g$` | Move to end of display line when wrap is enabled |
| `g^` | Move to first non-blank of display line when wrap is enabled |
| `gm` | Move to middle of the screen line |
| `{` | Move to previous blank line (paragraph) |
| `}` | Move to next blank line (paragraph) |
| `[[` | Move to previous section start (`{` in column 0) |
| `]]` | Move to next section start (`{` in column 0) |
| `[]` | Move to previous section end (`}` in column 0) |
| `][` | Move to next section end (`}` in column 0) |
| `[{` | Move to previous unmatched `{` (out of the enclosing block) |
| `]}` | Move to next unmatched `}` (out of the enclosing block) |
| `[(` | Move to previous unmatched `(` |
| `])` | Move to next unmatched `)` |
| `[m` | Move to previous method/function start |
| `]m` | Move to next method/function start |
| `[M` | Move to previous method/function end |
| `]M` | Move to next method/function end |
| `(` | Move to previous sentence |
| `)` | Move to next sentence |

The method motions `[m` `]m` `[M` `]M` jump between tree-sitter function
boundaries (functions and methods of the current language) instead of using
Vim's brace-scanning heuristic, so they land on real functions in Rust-style
code rather than on `if` braces. In files without tree-sitter support they do
nothing.

### File Movement

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `gg` | Move to start of file |
| `G` | Move to end of file |
| `{n}G` | Move to line n (e.g., `50G` goes to line 50) |
| `{n}go` | Go to byte n of the file |
| `%` | Jump to matching bracket `()`, `{}`, `[]` |

### Screen Movement

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `H` | Move to top of visible screen |
| `M` | Move to middle of visible screen |
| `L` | Move to bottom of visible screen |

### Find Character

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `f{char}` | Find character forward on current line |
| `F{char}` | Find character backward on current line |
| `t{char}` | Move till (before) character forward |
| `T{char}` | Move till (after) character backward |
| `;` | Repeat last `f`/`F`/`t`/`T` |
| `,` | Repeat last `f`/`F`/`t`/`T` in reverse |

> **Example:** `fa` moves cursor to the next `a`. `ta` moves cursor to just before the next `a`.

### Scrolling

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+f` | Scroll page down |
| `Ctrl+b` | Scroll page up |
| `Ctrl+d` | Scroll half page down |
| `Ctrl+u` | Scroll half page up |
| `Ctrl+e` | Scroll view down one line (cursor stays put) |
| `Ctrl+y` | Scroll view up one line (cursor stays put) |
| `zz` | Center cursor on screen |
| `zt` | Move cursor line to top of screen |
| `zb` | Move cursor line to bottom of screen |
| `z<CR>` / `z.` / `z-` | Like `zt` / `zz` / `zb`, then move to the first non-blank. All six take a count that goes to that line first: `5zt` puts line 5 at the top |
| `zh` / `zl` | Scroll the view left / right by a count of columns (wrap off) |
| `zH` / `zL` | Scroll the view left / right by half a screen (wrap off) |
| `zs` / `ze` | Scroll so the cursor sits at the left / right edge of the screen (wrap off) |

### Mouse

The mouse works like nvim's `mouse=nvi` (on by default). Turn it off with
`mouse = false` under `[editor]`, or at runtime with `:set nomouse` /
`:set mouse=` (any flags, like `:set mouse=a`, turn it back on).

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Wheel | Scroll the pane under the pointer 3 lines (cursor stays put) |
| Horizontal wheel | Scroll 6 columns (with wrap off) |
| Left click | Focus that pane and move the cursor there |
| Wheel / click on explorer | Move / set the selection |
| Wheel in finder | Scroll the preview pane |
| Wheel in markdown preview | Scroll the preview |

While the mouse is captured, use your terminal's bypass modifier for native
text selection and scrollback: Option on iTerm2, Shift on most others.

### Jump List

Nevi tracks where you jump from, so you can navigate back and forth.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+o` | Jump to older position |
| `Ctrl+i` | Jump to newer position |
| `''` | Jump to the line before the last jump |
| ``` `` ``` | Jump to the exact position before the last jump |
| <code>``</code> | Jump to the exact position before the last jump |

### Change List

Navigate through positions where you made edits.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `g;` | Jump to older change position |
| `g,` | Jump to newer change position |
| `'.` | Jump to the line of the last change |
| <code>`.</code> | Jump to the exact position of the last change |
| `'^` | Jump to the line of the last insert |
| <code>`^</code> | Jump to the exact position of the last insert |
| `'[` / `']` | Jump to the first / last line of the last changed or yanked text |
| <code>`[</code> / <code>`]</code> | Jump to the exact start / end of the last changed or yanked text |
| `'<` / `'>` | Jump to the first / last line of the last visual selection |
| <code>`<</code> / <code>`></code> | Jump to the exact start / end of the last visual selection |
| `gi` | Go to last insert position and enter insert mode |

---

## Editing

### Operators

Operators are commands that wait for a motion. For example, `d` (delete) + `w` (word) = `dw` (delete word).

| Operator | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `d` | Delete |
| `c` | Change (delete and enter insert mode) |
| `y` | Yank (copy) |
| `>` | Indent right |
| `<` | Indent left |
| `=` | Auto-indent |
| `gu` | Lowercase |
| `gU` | Uppercase |
| `g~` | Toggle case |

### Delete/Change/Yank

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `dd` | Delete entire line |
| `D` | Delete from cursor to end of line |
| `cc` | Change entire line |
| `C` | Change from cursor to end of line |
| `yy` | Yank entire line |
| `Y` | Yank from cursor to end of line |
| `x` / `{n}x` | Delete character(s) under cursor |
| `X` / `{n}X` | Delete character(s) before cursor |
| `s` / `{n}s` | Substitute character(s) under cursor |
| `S` / `{n}S` | Substitute entire line(s) |
| `p` / `{n}p` | Paste after cursor |
| `P` / `{n}P` | Paste before cursor |
| `gp` / `{n}gp` | Paste after and leave cursor after pasted text |
| `]p` | Paste after, adjusting the indent to the current line |
| `[p` / `[P` / `]P` | Paste before, adjusting the indent to the current line |
| `gP` / `{n}gP` | Paste before and leave cursor after pasted text |
| `r{char}` / `{n}r{char}` | Replace exactly one/count characters; `Enter` replaces them with one newline |
| `R` / `{n}R` | Enter replace mode; a count repeats the entered replacement text |
| `.` / `{n}.` | Repeat the last change; a count replaces the change's original count |
| `[<Space>` / `]<Space>` | Add an empty line above / below the cursor line, a count adds several |

> **Examples:**
> - `dw` - Delete from cursor to start of next word
> - `d$` - Delete from cursor to end of line
> - `diw` - Delete inner word (the word cursor is on)
> - `ci"` - Change inside quotes
> - `ya(` - Yank around parentheses

### Numbers

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+a` / `{n}Ctrl+a` | Add 1 (or count) to the number at or after the cursor |
| `Ctrl+x` / `{n}Ctrl+x` | Subtract 1 (or count) from the number at or after the cursor |

> **Note:** Like Neovim's default `nrformats=bin,hex`: decimal numbers with an optional `-`, `0x` hex, and `0b` binary. Leading zeros keep their width (`007` becomes `008`), hex digits keep their case, and the cursor lands on the last digit. Works with `.` and undoes in one step.

### Undo/Redo

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `u` | Undo |
| `Ctrl+r` | Redo |

### Indent

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `>>` | Indent current line |
| `<<` | Dedent current line |
| `>{motion}` | Indent with motion (e.g., `>j` indents current and next line) |
| `<{motion}` | Dedent with motion |
| `==` | Auto-indent current line |
| `={motion}` | Auto-indent with motion |

### Case

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `~` / `{n}~` | Toggle case of character(s) under cursor |
| `gu{motion}` | Lowercase with motion |
| `guu` | Lowercase entire line |
| `gU{motion}` | Uppercase with motion |
| `gUU` | Uppercase entire line |
| `g~{motion}` | Toggle case with motion |
| `g~~` | Toggle case of entire line |

### Join Lines

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `J` / `{n}J` | Join lines with spaces |
| `gJ` / `{n}gJ` | Join lines without adding spaces |

---

## Search

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Search forward |
| `?` | Search backward |
| `n` | Go to next match |
| `N` | Go to previous match |
| `*` | Search word under cursor forward |
| `#` | Search word under cursor backward |
| `g*` / `g#` | Same as `*` / `#` but also match inside longer words |
| `gn` | Search forward and select match |
| `gN` | Search backward and select match |

> **Note:** Search matches literal text and is case sensitive, like Vim with default settings. Regex patterns are not supported yet, with one exception: the word boundary atoms `\<` and `\>` work, so `/\<abc\>` matches `abc` only as a whole word. `*` and `#` search for `\<word\>` like Vim, which is why they skip the word when it sits inside a longer one.

### Search Prompt Editing

While typing a `/` or `?` search prompt.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+b` | Move to beginning of search input |
| `Ctrl+e` | Move to end of search input |
| `Ctrl+w` | Delete word before cursor |
| `Ctrl+u` | Delete from cursor to beginning of search input |
| `Ctrl+r {reg}` | Insert register contents |
| `Up` | Navigate to previous search history entry |
| `Down` | Navigate to next search history entry |

---

## Marks

Marks let you save positions and jump back to them later.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `m{a-z}` | Set local mark (buffer-specific) |
| `m{A-Z}` | Set global mark (works across files) |
| `'{a-z}` | Jump to line of local mark |
| `` `{a-z} `` | Jump to exact position of local mark |
| `'{A-Z}` | Jump to line of global mark |
| `` `{A-Z} `` | Jump to exact position of global mark |

**Commands:**
- `:marks` - Show all marks in interactive picker
- `:delmarks a` - Delete mark `a`
- `:delmarks a-d` - Delete marks `a` through `d`
- `:delmarks!` - Delete all lowercase marks in current buffer

> **Tip:** Use lowercase marks (`a-z`) for positions within a file, uppercase marks (`A-Z`) for jumping between files.

---

## Macros

Record and replay sequences of commands.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `q{a-z}` | Start recording macro into register |
| `q` | Stop recording (when recording) |
| `@{a-z}` | Play macro from register |
| `@@` | Replay last executed macro |
| `{n}@{a-z}` | Play macro n times |

> **Example:** `qa` starts recording into register `a`. Make your edits, press `q` to stop. Then `@a` replays it. `5@a` replays it 5 times.

### Macro Lens

View and edit recorded macros as readable key notation instead of re-recording.

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:Macros` | Open all recorded macros as notation in a read-only `[macros]` buffer |
| `:MacroEdit {a-z}` | Edit one register's notation in a `[macro-{register}]` scratch buffer; `:w` applies it back to the register (empty content clears it) |

> **Example:** after recording `qa`…`q`, run `:Macros` to see `@a  0f,ci"hello<Esc>j`. Typo in the macro? `:MacroEdit a`, fix the notation like any text, `:w`, and `@a` replays the corrected version. Newlines in the edit buffer are ignored, so long macros can be wrapped; a literal Enter is written as `<CR>`.

---

## Insert Mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `i` | Insert before cursor |
| `a` | Insert after cursor |
| `I` | Insert at first non-blank of line |
| `A` | Insert at end of line |
| `o` / `{n}o` | Open line(s) below; a count repeats the entered line |
| `O` / `{n}O` | Open line(s) above; a count repeats the entered line |
| `gi` | Go to last insert position and enter insert mode |

**While in Insert Mode:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Esc` or `Ctrl+[` | Exit insert mode |
| `Backspace` | Delete character before cursor |
| `Ctrl+w` | Delete word before cursor |
| `Ctrl+u` | Delete to start of line |
| `Ctrl+t` | Increase indent of current line |
| `Ctrl+d` | Decrease indent of current line |
| `Ctrl+a` | Insert previously inserted text |
| `Ctrl+r {reg}` | Insert contents of register |
| `Ctrl+o` | Run one normal-mode command, then return to insert |
| `Ctrl+v {key}` or `Ctrl+q {key}` | Insert the next key literally (e.g. `Ctrl+v` `Ctrl+y` inserts the `0x19` control character, `Ctrl+v` `Tab` a real tab) |
| `Ctrl+e` | Insert the character from the line below the cursor, by screen column (with the completion popup open, closes the popup instead) |
| `Ctrl+y` | Insert the character from the line above the cursor, by screen column (with the completion popup open, accepts the selected item instead) |

**Copilot (if enabled):**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+l` | Accept visible Copilot suggestion |
| `Alt+]` | Next visible Copilot suggestion |
| `Alt+[` | Previous visible Copilot suggestion |

---

## Replace Mode

Enter replace mode with `R`. Printable characters overwrite existing text and
extend the line when the cursor reaches its end. `Enter` inserts a newline and
keeps replace mode active. During straight-line input, `Backspace` restores
text overwritten in the current session and a count repeats the entered text.
Moving the cursor cancels that restoration and counted replay history.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Esc` or `Ctrl+[` | Exit replace mode |
| `Backspace` | Restore the previous straight-line replacement, or navigate backward after cursor movement |
| `Enter` | Insert a newline and continue replacing |

---

## Visual Mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `v` | Enter character-wise visual mode |

| `c` | Change selection |
| `y` | Yank selection |
| `p` | Paste over selection |
| `~` | Toggle case of selection |
| `u` / `U` | Lowercase / uppercase selection |
| `gu` / `gU` / `g~` | Lowercase / uppercase / toggle case of selection |
| `r{char}` | Replace every selected character with {char} |
| `J` / `gJ` | Join the selected lines with / without spaces, at least two |
| `=` | Re-indent the selected lines |
| `o` | Swap to other end of selection |

| `gv` | Reselect last visual selection (from normal mode) |

---

## Text Objects

Text objects define regions of text. Use them with operators (`d`, `c`, `y`, etc.).

**Inner vs Around:**
- `i` = inner (just the content)
- `a` = around (content + delimiters/whitespace)

| Text Object | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `iw` / `aw` | Inner/around word |
| `iW` / `aW` | Inner/around WORD |
| `i"` / `a"` | Inner/around double quotes |

> **Examples:**
> - `ci"` - Change inside double quotes
> - `da(` - Delete around parentheses (including the parens)
> - `yiw` - Yank inner word

---

## Registers

Registers are like named clipboards. Prefix operations with `"{register}`.

| Register | Description |
|----------|-------------|

| `1` - `9` | Open the numbered recent file |
| `h` then `1` - `9` | Jump to that harpoon slot (same slots as `<leader>1`-`<leader>4`) |

### Buffers

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|

| `:bp` / `:bprev` / `:N` / `:prev` | Previous buffer |
| `Ctrl+^` | Switch to the alternate buffer, the one this window showed last (reopens it if closed) |
| `[b` / `]b` | Previous / next buffer, a count moves several |
| `:bd` / `:bdelete` | Close current buffer (fails if unsaved) |
| `:bd!` / `:bdelete!` | Force close current buffer |

> **Note:** The alternate file is tracked once for the whole editor, not per window like Vim, so switching buffers in one split also changes what `Ctrl+^` and the `"#` register point at in the other.

### Splits

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:vs` / `:vsplit` | Vertical split |
| `:sp` / `:split` | Horizontal split |

| Command | Action |

| `:ProjectReplaceApply` / `:PReplaceApply` | Apply the last project replace preview |

`ProjectReplace` is preview-first. It does not write files until
`:ProjectReplaceApply` is run. V1 uses literal matching, respects the file
finder ignore settings, skips non-UTF-8 files, and blocks apply if a matched
file has unsaved changes or changed on disk after the preview was created. Use
an alternate delimiter such as `#` when the pattern or replacement contains `/`,
for example `:ProjectReplace#/api/v1#/api/v2#g`.
